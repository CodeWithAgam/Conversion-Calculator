# Conversion-Calculator

Struggling to calculate Perimeter, Area, Volume, Surface Area, Curved Surface Area and Area of 4 walls of different shapes? 
Here are few codes built in Python to solve your problem.

### The codes are written in simple and beginner-friendly Python with all the pre-included stuff.

# All the operations are listed below:

```
     1. Perimeter
     2. Area
     3. Volume
     4. Surface Area
     5. Curved Surface Area
     6. Area of 4 walls
     7. Simple Interest
     8. Body Mass Index (BMI)
```

# All the shapes covered in the calculators are listed below:

```
     1. Square - Perimeter/Area/Volume
     2. Rectangle - Perimeter/Area/Volume
     3. Triangle - Perimeter/Area/Volume
     4. Circle - Circumference (Perimeter)/Area
     5. Parallelogram - Perimeter/Area
     6. Cube - Volume/Surface Area/Area of 4 walls
     7. Cuboid - Volume/Surface Area/Area of 4 walls
     8. Cyclinder - Volume/Surface Area/Curved Surface Area
```

# *What's New?*

```
     1. Updated the Body Mass Index with a new feature. (bmi.py)
     2. Updated the README.md
