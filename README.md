# Conversion-Calculator
5 calculators built in Python to calculate Perimeter, Area, Volume, Surface Area and Area of 4 walls of different shapes.

The codes are written in simple and beginner-friendly Python coding. The calculators use a simple Python module named "Math" 
which comes pre-installed with all the versions of Python and allows us to use the calculators and carry on the calculators.

All the shapes covered in the function are listed below:

     1. Square - Perimeter/Area/Volume
     2. Rectangle - Perimeter/Area/Volume
     3. Triangle - Perimeter/Area/Volume
     4. Circle - Circumference (Perimeter)/Area
     5. Parallelogram - Perimeter/Area
     6. Cube - Volume/Surface Area/Area of 4 walls
     7. Cuboid - Volume/Surface Area/Area of 4 walls
     8. Cyclinder - Volume/Surface Area
